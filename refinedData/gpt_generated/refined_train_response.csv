Therefore, all the questions and answers provided are essential for clarifying the specifics of the car rental, such as the type of car, pickup and return locations, and times. None of the questions should be discarded as they all add necessary details that were not included in the abstract.

Rate: 
- conciseness: 5 (all questions contribute directly to clarifying the task without repetition),
- usefulness: 5 (each question adds a critical detail that specifies the task requirements),
- verbosity: 4 (questions are straightforward but could be slightly more concise).
